Surprisingly, the most classic Czech dishes aren't even all that Czech.

Most popular dishes:
1. Goulash
2. Schnitzel
3. Beef in cream sauce

## Goulash is Hungarian

Isn't it?

## Schnitzel is Austrian

Like you couldn't've guessed.

## Beef in cream sauce...

Is French! That one may be a bit surprising, but on second thought, probably isn't.

## Where to find them?

Caf√© Louvre is my favourite.
