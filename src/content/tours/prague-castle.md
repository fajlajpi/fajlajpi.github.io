## Tour Overview

Explore the fascinating history of the Prague Castle. The top of the hill overlooking the city has been the seat of power over Bohemia for as long as there's been history to talk about, with eleven centuries known to use, and even more hidden beneath. Dukes, Kings, Emperors and Presidents have walked the halls of the Prague Castle, and have written stories that we are proud to share centuries later.

For your convenience, we usually take a tram to the top of the hill and walk mostly downhill on the tour, exploring all the major courtyards of the Castle. The tour usually does not include any interiors, but we can include them upon request, just let us know.
